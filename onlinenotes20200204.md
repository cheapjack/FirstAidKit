## Clustering
- Divide the cards, into employers and employee?
- Cluster issues (because both need to know about contracts, benefits, leaves, etc.)

### Legal
* Contract
* types of contracts?
* Working Hours
* overtime
* sick pay?
* Obligations
* Non-payment

### Leaves
* Religious holidays
* Menstrual leaves

### Benefits

### Ways to sustain organisation
- Finances: If they were to set up a design company, how can they set up organisation bank accounts?
- Legal status: CV, PT, Yayasan, Koperasi

### Structures of Protection
* Unions
* Cooperatives

### Tools
- What tools do you use? Are they open source? ..... Remote work tools e.g. jitsi

### BONUS : Supporting a cause

## FOR THE BACK OF THE CARDS
Temporality? 
Thinking about travel, remote working, how does that work?

## Feedback for remote collaboration rather than flying in so far
* We get to experiment with communication tools--some open source ones--as remote workers exprience them, which we can include in the cards
* Carbon trail saving
* We get longer time to build up, feed into each other rather than just short-term
* Postal packages have been very helpful in shaping ideas
* Having met once also help in building trust

## IMPORTANT DATES
* Around 20 Feb: send the prototype to Hwa Young and BC
* End of Feb: Prototype day to show people, work in progress (WIP) presentation to get feedback 
People/orgs that are involved: Petra University, ITS, art collectives (Riree, kerjasama 59), Ciputra University
* 28 March: public presentation of projects in Surabaya
* If we want to do something outside Surabaya (eg Jakarta), need to do before March
* Early April: Send the hardcopies
