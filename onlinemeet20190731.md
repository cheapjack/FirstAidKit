# Notes for online chats on 31 July 2019
Hwa Young, Ross, and kat
Tried using wheeliepad, but internet seems to be not stable enough. Ended up using [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/).

We are discussing about how we proceed in making the kit. One idea that popped up about the making of the kit is if we make games that can help craft the collective experience of precarity. It can be a play on snake and ladder or monopoly, a way to make people realise the condition that they are in, how they get out, etc. (but yes, we'll try to be more creative than S&L and Monopoly!). Some of the references that popped up during the chats are:

http://probationary.co.uk/
*Probationary: The Game of Life on Licence* explores the lived experience of being on probation. Hwa Young was involved in this.

A kind of skipping rope like game in Korea

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asian_mancala
Dakon, which we play in Indonesia (and plenty in Southeast Asia it seems)

http://www.protestgames.org/
an ongoing collection of games to be played in the context of marches, rallies, occupations and other protests. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_Struggle_(board_game)
a board game for two to six players, designed by Professor Bertell Ollman. It was published in 1978 by Avalon Hill. The game was intended to teach players about the politics of Marxism, and was loosely compared the board game, Monopoly.

With plenty of leftist references, this also made us wonder about the relations today between coworking (and maker?) spaces and trade/labour unions. The issues discussed in the [first workshop note](https://github.com/cheapjack/P3K/blob/master/discussion01.md) seems quite widespread to tackle. 

Kat mentioned [*Ghost Work*](https://ghostwork.info/) by Mary L. Gray which also had some sections pondering about the role of coworking or shared spaces for today's remote, dispersed workers. 

We are making a list of games here: https://github.com/cheapjack/P3K/wiki/Games-Ideas-&-Notes

Next meeting we'll brainstorm on how we interpret this into our own game for the kit.
